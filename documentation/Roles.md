### Teamwork

Dillan, Hamzah and Ahsan are all team workers and this means they can provide a lot of support and collaborative efforts. Other than ensuring work is completed, it creates a positive work environment and allows us to work together towards the goals.

## Team Weaknesses

### Conflicts may arise

The addition of many Plants in the team may cause some conflicts. Even though Plants can be creative, the use of uncommon ideas may not always be in line with what the team is trying to achieve.

### Too much focus on detail

Likewise, too many Complete Finishers has potential to become to narrow and focused on the details to ensure high quality work is given, and may abandon other parts of the project, which may pose an issue later down in the line and potentially even delays to the process.

## Risk Mitigation Plan

We have decided to implement the following risk mitigation plan based on our teams strengths and weaknesses:

**Balancing workload with organisation**

We have created a project timeline, with deadlines of the milestones for each sprint and a final deliverable version in our GitHub repository. To ensure progress can be tracked, the team created labels. Our aim is to use this tool, for categorisation, this will make it easier to track and manage closely related items for each sprint. It will also allow us to prioritise tasks, as they can be labelled depending on their importance, and therefore the most critical parts can be addressed swiftly.

**The need for open communication channels**

We have setup two weekly meetings to take place, once at the the start of the week in person and then one online meeting later in the week. In addition to this, the team have created a WhatsApp group chat. This collaborative environment, will give team members the flexibility to share their ideas and allow for critical feedback to be provided at anytime.

**Providing emotional support**

As this project will consist of technical challenges with tight deadlines, this can be mentally challenging. Our aim is to ensure members aren’t anxious or feeling stressed. We have created a comfortable friendly environment so every member is comfortable in sharing their feelings. We understand if team members are supported, there is likely to be an increase in their productivity levels and therefore ensures all deadlines are met. 

**Assignment of roles**

To ensure the team works effectively, each members strengths must be utilised. For example, Abdullah is our chair, he possesses exceptional leadership qualities which ensures the team have a clear structure in achieving each milestone towards our final deliverable. By combining the various skill sets of each members, we aim to mitigate as much risk as possible. We will ensure our collective weaknesses don’t arise to become an issue, and we are able to successfully deliver the projects goal.

## Team Evaluation

Ultimately, the team possesses a versatile and effective balance of personalities and skill sets along with specialists, leaders, and team workers. The collaborative approach from different angles can showcase a complement of each other's individual Belbin roles. The team must stay aware of the possibility of their weaknesses being an issue, and prevent being too focused over details and unconventional ideas.
