This document will explain the rationale behind the front end of the website

Before even starting to create the front-end, we decided to do some background research on what a good web page for a Gym/Leisure centre entails and we did this by looking at our competitions, other established gyms and leisure centres.

Firstly we started with leisure centres, so we looked at local council leisure centres:

They all had the same format and it wasn't very appealing. The page layout was very narrow with a lot of white space, however they were very functional. Having a nav bar at the top allowing you to access the necessary information was a crucial part and the big buttons which would take you to specific pages were a source of inspiration.

We then turned to gyms and had a look at all the major ones.
Key features we picked up from these gyms were the use of large pictures, accessible nav bars which would lead you to pages you want to go in the click of a button.

Other gyms such as pure gym and the gym used burger buttons with side bars to represent the nav bar which we found weren't as intuitive as the traditional nav bar at the top of the page, so we opted in to that approach.
However all the websites incorporated a footer so we ensured that we would also have one.

We first began with sketching rough designs of our landing page, coming to three different options:

We decided to go with the final out of the three as it incorporated everything that we had researched and gave us an 'xtra' section where we could add anything else that we would like. 

We then had to decide what would be incorporated into the nav bar.
We had decided we wanted all the main pages to be involved with the nav bar right on the top as well as a logo which we would have to develop ourselves.
The main pages at the nav bar are the home page (which would be incorporated into the logo as a clickable button), the facilities, memberships, registration, logging in/logging out (depending on the current login status).

Here were our two mock-ups for our nav bars, we chose the latter since it looked nicer, and functionality wise the login/register button being isolated from the rest makes it easier for the user.

We then moved onto the footer where we also had many different mock-ups, on placement of the logo, socials buttons and the important links. 
It had to have relevant links, and like the nav bar, present on almost every page. We began by looking at footers of the same gym and leisure sites so we could have a good foundation.

Looking at these two nav bars we created some mock-ups which we felt would give the most functionality to the users but was also aesthetically pleasing.

We decided to go with the layout on the left. 

Finally for the colour scheme of the website we decided to lean towards a more luxury sort of aesthetic and believed black and gold were the perfect colour combo to achieve this.
