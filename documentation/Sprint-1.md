## Review and Evaluation

Weekly team meetings on Mondays to review progress and discuss any issues or roadblocks Biweekly demos to stakeholders to showcase completed work and gather feedback Final review meeting on Friday of week 2 to evaluate the success of the sprint and identify areas for improvement.
