# Pricing

Research on pricing is essential in helping us understand our target audience. It enables us to understand the customers needs but most importantly what they would be willing to pay us in order to use our sports centre facilities. To attract our target audience, we must offer them competitive prices. To help us with this, we can assess the prices of our competitors, for similar services they offer and then set our own. If prices are too high, our targeted users may not be able to afford services, leading to long term failure. Another factor we took into account when setting the price, was if a reasonable profit margin would be generated, after offsetting costs of setting everything up.

After taking factors like 'Customer needs', 'long term success' and 'profitability' into consideration alongside our analysis, we decided to keep a fixed price of £4 for both Adults and Junior for all categories. By keeping the prices the same no matter the age, we as a sports facility intend to promote inclusivity and promote a warm welcoming atmosphere, allowing people from different age groups to participate confidently in the same activities. Another reason is, customers would feel more satisfied they're being treated fairly, if they see that everyone else is paying the same price for using facilities.
