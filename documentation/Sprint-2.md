## Goal
Our overall goal for sprint 2 is to implement the majority of the project's core functionality.
***

## Tasks

Below is a list of specific tasks we need to complete in order to achieve our goal
* here are the backlog tasks we're aiming to have at least mostly finished:
  * Implement booking system
  * Implement employee page
  * Implement manager page
  * Implement payment system
  * Design and implement CSS frontend
* initially wanted to implement extra functionality for the backlog optional feature, but decided this should be left for later given that it's lower priority.

## Review and Evaluation

As before, are doing weekly team meetings on Mondays to review progress and discuss any issues or roadblocks Biweekly demos to stakeholders to showcase completed work and gather feedback. Progress is still tracked using milestones. Additionally, on Friday of 4th week, doing peer review of video presentations.

**Below are some examples of our completed issues**

**Documentation** 

* Sprint 2 wiki documentation done along with sprint 2 meeting minutes
* Sprint 2 video done

**Enhancement**

* Test suite created
* Booking system mostly implemented
* Manager page partly implemented with some functionality being hard coded
* CSS frontend for home page and facilities page done, may be further refined though
* Payment system implemented, still needs refining
* initial tests created for commits to dev and main branches

**Outcomes**

* Overall, the system is largely implemented, though there are still gaps in functionality, and a lot of it is still rough around the edges and buggy
* Progress is as expected
* We've decided to scrap the work with us page and instead implement a contact us form in sprint 3
